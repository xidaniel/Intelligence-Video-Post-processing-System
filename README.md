# Video-analysis-and-algorithm-optimization

# Abstract
In this project, We will use Mask-RCNN algorithm and OpenCV framework to analyze lecture video.
We will use Mask-RCNN to detect person and screen, then combine them to a new layout.
I wrote a python module named newlayout to combine person and screen automatically.


# There are there option for new layout class.
Let's see the original video and outputs.
